Coding Challenge

1. Had to use GIMP since I have no access to photoshop, so some of the
   colors and images (particularly the pattern background on the main
heading) may not be true to the PSD file.
2. Did not update for ie9 since I do not have acess to it either. But
   did test in chrome, firefox, and safari.
